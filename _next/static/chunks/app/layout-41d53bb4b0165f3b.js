Traditionally, they wandered from village to village, carrying their homes on camel carts, performing music, dance, and snake-charming.\n    \nUnlike settled communities, Kalbeliyas lived on the outer fringes of towns, setting up temporary camps wherever work was available. Their identity is deeply connected to nature: the desert, snakes, herbal medicines, and storytelling. Though modern laws have restricted snake-charming, their cultural heritage—music, dance, craftsmanship—continues to thrive.

No fixed land ownership in earlier centuries.\n2. Mobility was essential to finding work—performing, trading herbs, catching snakes, and selling natural remedies.\n\nThey traveled in groups, following seasonal patterns: monsoons for hunting reptiles, winters for festival performances, summers for long-distance migration.
